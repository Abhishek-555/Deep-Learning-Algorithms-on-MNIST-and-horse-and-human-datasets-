This repo contains Deep learning algorithms that perform image analysis on MNIST and horse and human dataset

The MNIST training set is composed of 50,000 patterns of alphabets and the algorihm was trained upto 1000 epoches to recognise the alphabets with 99 percent accuracy.

The horse and human ipynb file was trained for 1000 epoches to classify whether the input image is a horse or a human.
